      <h4>Private Limited Company</h4>
      <p align="justify">A Private Limited Company is a type of business structure registered to give a separate legal existence to the business apart from its directors and shareholders.

In a Private Limited Company, the shareholders are considered to be the owners of the company and the directors are responsible for the everyday operations of the business. This ensures that the personal assets of the shareholders and directors are separate from that of the company.
