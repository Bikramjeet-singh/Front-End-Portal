# Responsive Website 

This is a Front-end Project based on HTML, CSS , Bootstrap and JavaScript.
I've tried to use many features of all data sets. I've used Images and placed them in the grid. Feature of grid is based on the size of the screen of the device.
JavaScript is used here for transitions and button functioning.
